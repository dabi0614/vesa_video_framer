These VHDL source code files implement a VESA timing standard compatible video framer.
The modules are splitted into several files with the following description:
 1- video_framer.vhd
	The actual video framer, generating Data Enable (DE), Horizontal Sync (HS), Vertical Sync (VS) signals.
	Using the res_sel input signal, it is possible to chose between 2 image resolution modes:
		- if res_sel = 0 then 1920x1200
		- if res_sel = 1 then 1280x1024
	Note: For each resolution, a specific clock frequency is required. This clock must be set manually in
	the testbench before simulation (c.f. testbench description).
 2- image_gen.vhd
	Piloted by the DE signal generated by the video_framer, this generator outputs a 24-bit RGB signal.
	For demo purpose, the generator produces a RBG signal that renders a grey ramp of 256 shades, starting from black
	and ending with white. It keeps repeating this ramp.
 3- top_video_framer.vhd
	A module that is composed of the video framer and image generator described above.

Two testbenches are included in this set of files:
 1- testbench.vhd
	The testbench description file that was used to simulate the video framer as a standalone module.
	Note: At line 28, you can choose either resolution mode 0 (1920x1200) or mode 1 (1280x1024). Depending on this 
	selection, one must also adapt the clock frequency at line 39: clk_freq_mode0 for mode 0, clk_freq_mode 1 for
	mode 1.
 2- top_testbench.vhd
	The testbench description file that was used to simulate the top video framer module.
	Note: At line 29, you can choose either resolution mode 0 (1920x1200) or mode 1 (1280x1024). Depending on this 
	selection, one must also adapt the clock frequency at line 42: clk_freq_mode0 for mode 0, clk_freq_mode 1 for
	mode 1.
